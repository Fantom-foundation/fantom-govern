# Governance contract

Governance contract supports on-chain voting by arbitrary members on arbitrary topics. Each voting topic is called a "proposal".

The contract is designed to be universal and flexible:
- The governance isn't coupled to any specific staking contract, but relies on an interface to get voter weights.
- It supports multi-delegations between voters. A voter can delegate their vote to another voter.
- It supports on-chain execution of the proposals. On approval, each proposal may perform arbitrary actions on behalf of the governance contract.
- The contract permits multiple options for proposals, and multiple degrees of an agreement for each vote.
- An arbitrary number of proposal templates are permitted. Each proposal can specify its parameters (such as voting turnout or deadlines) within the boundaries of a template.
- It can handle an arbitrary number of active proposals simultaneously.
- The contract can also support an arbitrary number of active voters simultaneously.

# Test

1. Install nodejs 10.5.0
2. `npm install -g truffle@v5.1.4` # install truffle v5.1.4
3. `npm update`
4. `npm test`

If everything is allright, it should output something along this:
```
> governance@1.0.0 test /home/up/w/fantom-govern
> truffle test
